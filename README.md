ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rachid, with deep experience in UI/UX and passion to web3 coding, I hope to make the blockchain easy and available for every one. The technology is so powerful but it's hard for peoples to use and integrate. This why I am here, I want kids to use the blockchain in their projects,,easy just drag & drop :)
