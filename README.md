ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Rachid. I have extensive experience in UI/UX and a passion for web3 coding. My goal is to make blockchain technology easily accessible to everyone, including children. I believe that this powerful technology should be simple and intuitive to use, allowing kids to easily incorporate it into their projects using drag-and-drop tools. I am dedicated to making this a reality.
